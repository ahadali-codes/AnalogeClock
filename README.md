## 🕒 Project Overview

A beautifully styled, animated analog clock built purely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It shows the current time with moving hour, minute, and second hands, plus a digital time/date display (if you added that).  
The design emphasizes smooth animations, responsive layout, and modern styling.
